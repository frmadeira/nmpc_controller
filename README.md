# nmpc_controller
**Overview:**

This repository contains the source code for a Nonlinear Model Predictive Controller (NMPC) designed for trajectory tracking and obstacle avoidance. The controller can perform avoiding action from both static and moving obstacles. It is developed using Python 3.10.11. and is intended for use as a local planner for a differential drive robot in a factory environment, though adaptable for use with different scenarios and vehicle dynamics.
